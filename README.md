# Sudoku Solver Solution
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Given an incomplete Sudoku configuration in terms of a 9 x 9  2-D square matrix (grid[][]), the task is to find a solved Sudoku. For simplicity, you may assume that there will be only one unique solution.

<h3>A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.</li>
<li>Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.</li>
<li>Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.</li>
<li>Zeros in the grid indicates blanks, which are to be filled with some number between 1-9. You can not replace the element in the cell which is not blank.</li>
</ul>
